            The GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash) is a program that interprets commands that the user types. 
            Each string that is typed into the shell can have up to three parts: the command, options 
            (which usually begin with a hyphen - or double hyphen -- characters), and arguments. 
            Each word that is typed into the shell is separated from other words with spaces.
        </p>
        <code>whoami</code>
        <p>
            To type more than one command on a single line, use the semicolon (;) as a command separator. 
            A semicolon is a member of a class of characters called metacharacters that have a special interpretation for bash. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The date command displays the current date and time.
        </p>
        <code>date</code></br>
        <code>date +%x</code>
        <p>The passwd command with no options changes the current user's password.</p>
        <code>passwd</code>
        <p>
            Linux does not require file name extensions to classify files by type. 
            The file command scans the compiled header of a file for a 2-digit magic number and displays its type.
        </p>
        <code>file /etc/passwd</code></br>
        <code>file /bin/passwd</code></br>
        <code>file /home</code>
        <p>
            The cat command is often used in Linux. Use this command to create single or multiple files, view the contents of files, 
            concatenate the contents from various files, and redirect contents of the file to a terminal or to files.
        </p>
        <code>cat /etc/passwd</code></br>
        <code>cat file1 file2</code>
        <p>
            The cat command does not display the contents of a file as pages. 
            The less command displays one page of a file at a time and you can scroll at your leisure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The head and tail commands display the beginning and the end of a file, respectively. 
            By default, these commands display 10 lines of the file, but they both have a -n option to specify a different number of lines.
        </p>
        <code>head /etc/passwd</code><br>
        <code>tail -n 3 /etc/passwd</code>
        <p>
            The wc command counts lines, words, and characters in a file. 
            Use the -l, -w, or -c options to display only the given number of lines, words, or characters, respectively.
        </p>
        <code>wc /etc/passwd</code><br>
        <code>wc -l /etc/passwd ; wc -l /etc/group</code><br>
        <code>wc -c /etc/group /etc/hosts</code>
        <p>
            With tab completion, users can quickly complete commands or file names after typing enough at the prompt to make it unique. 
            If the typed characters are not unique, then pressing the Tab key twice displays all commands that begin with the typed characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the useradd command to create users on the system. The useradd command has many options that might be hard to remember. 
            By using tab completion, you can complete the option name with minimal typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            To write one command in more than one line, use a backslash character (\), which is referred to as the escape character. 
            The backslash character ignores the meaning of the following character.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history command displays a list of previously executed commands that are prefixed with a command number.
        </p>
        <code>history</code>
        <p>
            The exclamation point character (!) is a metacharacter to expand previous commands without retyping them. 
            The !number command expands to the command that matches the specified number. 
            The !string command expands to the most recent command that begins with the specified string.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Alt+. key combination is particularly convenient, 
            because you can hold down Alt and press . repeatedly to quickly cycle earlier commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ctrl+A	Jump to the beginning of the command line.
            Ctrl+E	Jump to the end of the command line.
