            The GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash) is a program that interprets commands that the user types. 
            Each string that is typed into the shell can have up to three parts: the command, options 
            (which usually begin with a hyphen - or double hyphen -- characters), and arguments. 
            Each word that is typed into the shell is separated from other words with spaces.
        </p>
        <code>whoami</code>
        <p>
            To type more than one command on a single line, use the semicolon (;) as a command separator. 
            A semicolon is a member of a class of characters called metacharacters that have a special interpretation for bash. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The date command displays the current date and time.
        </p>
        <code>date</code></br>
        <code>date +%x</code>
        <p>The passwd command with no options changes the current user's password.</p>
        <code>passwd</code>
        <p>
            Linux does not require file name extensions to classify files by type. 
            The file command scans the compiled header of a file for a 2-digit magic number and displays its type.
        </p>
        <code>file /etc/passwd</code></br>
        <code>file /bin/passwd</code></br>
        <code>file /home</code>
        <p>
            The cat command is often used in Linux. Use this command to create single or multiple files, view the contents of files, 
            concatenate the contents from various files, and redirect contents of the file to a terminal or to files.
        </p>
        <code>cat /etc/passwd</code></br>
        <code>cat file1 file2</code>
        <p>
            The cat command does not display the contents of a file as pages. 
            The less command displays one page of a file at a time and we can scroll at our leisure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The head and tail commands display the beginning and the end of a file, respectively. 
            By default, these commands display 10 lines of the file, but they both have a -n option to specify a different number of lines.
        </p>
        <code>head /etc/passwd</code><br>
        <code>tail -n 3 /etc/passwd</code>
        <p>
            The wc command counts lines, words, and characters in a file. 
            Use the -l, -w, or -c options to display only the given number of lines, words, or characters, respectively.
        </p>
        <code>wc /etc/passwd</code><br>
        <code>wc -l /etc/passwd ; wc -l /etc/group</code><br>
        <code>wc -c /etc/group /etc/hosts</code>
        <p>
            With tab completion, users can quickly complete commands or file names after typing enough at the prompt to make it unique. 
            If the typed characters are not unique, then pressing the Tab key twice displays all commands that begin with the typed characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the useradd command to create users on the system. The useradd command has many options that might be hard to remember. 
            By using tab completion, we can complete the option name with minimal typing.
        </p>
        <p>
            To write one command in more than one line, use a backslash character (\), which is referred to as the escape character. 
            The backslash character ignores the meaning of the following character.
        </p>
        <p>
            The history command displays a list of previously executed commands that are prefixed with a command number.
        </p>
        <code>history</code>
        <p>
            The exclamation point character (!) is a metacharacter to expand previous commands without retyping them. 
            The !number command expands to the command that matches the specified number. 
            The !string command expands to the most recent command that begins with the specified string.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Alt+. key combination is particularly convenient, 
            because we can hold down Alt and press . repeatedly to quickly cycle earlier commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ctrl+A	Jump to the beginning of the command line.
            Ctrl+E	Jump to the end of the command line.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/0002.png" alt="img" width="100%" />
        <p>
            Relative path names follow this rule: a path name with anything other than a forward slash as the first character is a relative path name. 
            For example, relative to the /var directory, the message log file is log/messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Linux file systems, including ext4, XFS, GFS2, and GlusterFS, are case-sensitive. 
            Creating the FileCase.txt and filecase.txt files in the same directory results in two unique files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pwd command displays the full path name of the current working directory for that shell. This command helps us to determine the syntax to reach files by using relative path names. 
            The ls command lists directory contents for the specified directory or, if no directory is given, for the current working directory.
        </p>
        <code>pwd</code><br>
        <code>ls</code>
        <p>
            The ls command has multiple options for displaying attributes on files. The most common options are -l (long listing format), 
            -a (all files, including hidden files), and -R (recursive, to include the contents of all subdirectories).
        </p>
        <code>ls -l</code><br>
        <code>ls -la</code>
        <p>
            At the top of the listing are two special directories. One dot (.) refers to the current directory, and two dots (..) refer to the parent directory. 
            These special directories exist in every directory on the system, and they are useful when using file management commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the cd command to change our shell's current working directory. 
            If we do not specify any arguments to the command, then it changes to our home directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cd - command changes to the previous directory, where the user was previously to the current directory. 
        </p>
        <code>cd -</code>
        <p>
            The prompt displays the tilde character (~) when our current working directory is our home directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            The touch command updates the time stamp of a file to the current date and time without otherwise modifying it. 
            This command is useful for creating empty files.
        </p>
        <code>touch</code>
        <p>
            The mkdir command creates one or more directories or subdirectories. 
            It takes as an argument a list of paths to the directories that we want to create
        </p>
        <code>mkdir ProjectX ProjectY ProjectZ</code>
        <p>
            If the directory exists, or a parent directory of the directory that we are trying to create does not exist, 
            then the mkdir command fails and it displays an error.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mkdir command -p (parent) option creates any missing parent directories for the requested destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cp command copies a file, and creates a file either in the current directory or in a different specified directory.
        </p>
        <code>cp</code>
        <p>
            We can also use the cp command to copy multiple files to a directory. In this scenario, the last argument must be a directory. The copied files retain their original names in the new directory. 
            If a file with the same name exists in the target directory, then the existing file is overwritten.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the cp command does not copy directories; it ignores them.
            We can copy directories and their contents by using the cp command -r option. 
        </p>
        <code>cp -r</code>
        <p>
            The mv command moves files from one location to another. If we think of the absolute path to a file as its full name, 
            then moving a file is effectively the same as renaming a file. The contents of the files that are moved remain unchanged.
        </p>
        <code>mv</code><br>
        <code>mv -v</code>
        <p>
            The rm command removes files. By default, rm does not remove directories. We can use the rm command -r or the --recursive option 
            to enable the rm command to remove directories and their contents. 
            The rm -r command traverses each subdirectory first, and individually removes their files before removing each directory.
            We can use the rm command -i option to interactively prompt for confirmation before deleting. This option is essentially the opposite of using the 
            rm command -f option, which forces the removal without prompting the user for confirmation.
            If We specify both the -i and -f options, then the -f option takes priority and we are not prompted for confirmation before rm removes files.
        </p>
        <code>rm</code><br>
        <code>rm -r</code><br>
        <code>rm -i</code><br>
        <code>rm -f</code>
        <p>
            We can also use the rmdir command to remove empty directories. Use the rm command -r option to remove non-empty directories.
        </p>
        <code>rmdir</code>
        <p>
            We can create multiple file names that point to the same file. These file names are called links.
            We can create two types of links: a hard link, or a symbolic link (sometimes called a soft link).
        </p>
        <p>
            Every file starts with a single hard link, from its initial name to the data on the file system. 
            When we create a hard link to a file, we create another name that points to that same data.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use the ln command to create a hard link (another file name) that points to an existing file. 
            The command needs at least two arguments: a path to the existing file, and the path to the hard link that we want to create.
        </p>
        <code>ln filename1 filename2</code>
        <p>
            To determine whether two files are hard linked, use the ls command -i option to list each file's inode number. 
            If the files are on the same file system and their inode numbers are the same, then the files are hard links that point to the same data file content.
        </p>
        <code>ls -il filename1 filename2</code>
        <p>
            Hard links that reference the same file share the inode structure with the link count, access permissions, user and group ownership, time stamps, and file content. 
            When that information is changed for one hard link, then the other hard links for the same file also show the new information. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if the original file is deleted, we can still access the contents of the file provided that at least one other hard link exists. 
            Data is deleted from storage only when the last hard link is deleted, which makes the file contents unreferenced by any hard link.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hard links have some limitations. First, we can use hard links only with regular files. 
            We cannot use the ln command to create a hard link to a directory or special file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, we can use hard links only if both files are on the same file system. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use the df command to list the directories that are on different file systems. 
        </p>
        <code>df</code>
        <p>
            The ln command -s option creates a symbolic link, which is also called a "soft link". 
            A symbolic link is not a regular file, but a special type of file that points to an existing file or directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Symbolic links have some advantages over hard links: Symbolic links can link two files on different file systems.
            Symbolic links can point to a directory or special file, not just to a regular file.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we type a command at the Bash shell prompt, the shell processes that command line through multiple expansions before running it. 
            We can use these shell expansions to perform complex tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.
        </p>
        <p>Following are the main expansions that Bash shell performs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brace expansion, which can generate multiple strings of characters</li>
            <li>Tilde expansion, which expand to a path to a user home directory</li>
            <li>Variable expansion, which replaces text with the value that is stored in a shell variable</li>
            <li>Command substitution, which replaces text with the output of a command</li>
            <li>Pathname expansion, which helps to select one or more files by pattern matching</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="./images/0003.png" alt="img" width="70%" />
        <code>ls a*</code><br>
        <code>ls [ac]*</code>
        <p>
            Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings of characters. Brace expansions might be nested, one inside another. 
            We can also use double-dot syntax (..), which expands to a sequence. For example, the {m..p} double-dot syntax inside braces expands to m n o p.
        </p>
        <code>echo file{1..3}.txt</code><br>
        <code>mkdir ../RHEL{7,8,9}</code><br>
        <code>ls ../RHEL*</code>
        <p>
            A variable acts like a named container that stores a value in memory. We can assign data as a value to a variable and 
            use variable expansion to convert the variable name to its value on the command line. If a string starts with a dollar sign ($), 
            then the shell tries to use the rest of that string as a variable name and to replace it with the variable value.
        </p>
        <code>VARIABLENAME=value</code><br>
        <code>echo $VARIABLENAME</code>
        <p>
            To prevent mistakes due to other shell expansions, we can put the name of the variable in curly braces, for example ${VARIABLENAME}.
        </p>
        <p>
            Command substitution enables the output of a command to replace the command itself on the command line. 
            Command substitution occurs when we enclose a command in parentheses and precede it by a dollar sign ($). 
            The $(command) form can nest multiple command expansions inside each other.
        </p>
        <code>echo The time is $(date +%M) minutes past $(date +%l%p)</code>
        <p>
            Many characters have a special meaning in the Bash shell. To prevent shell expansions on parts of our command line, 
            we can quote and escape characters and strings. The backslash (\) is an escape character in the Bash shell. 
            To protect longer character strings, we can use single quotation marks (') or double quotation marks (") to enclose strings.
        </p>
        <p>
            One source of documentation that is generally available on the local system is system manual pages or man pages. 
            The pages are stored in subdirectories of the /usr/share/man directory. To read specific man pages, use the man topic command. 
            To display the man page topic from a specific section, you can use the man section topic command.
        </p>
        <code>man passwd</code><br>
        <code>man 5 passwd</code>
        <p>
            Popular system administration topics are in sections 1 (user commands), 5 (file formats), and 8 (administrative commands). 
            Administrators who use certain troubleshooting tools also use section 2 (system calls). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the man command -k option (equivalent to the apropos command) to search for a keyword in man page titles and descriptions. 
        </p>
        <code>man -k passwd</code>
        <p>
            The man command -K (uppercase) option searches for the keyword in the full-text page, not only in the titles and descriptions. 
            A full-text search uses greater system resources and takes more time.
        </p>
        <code>man -K passwd</code>
        <p>
            A running program, or process, reads input and writes output. A process uses numbered channels called file descriptors to get input and send output. 
            All processes start with at least three file descriptors. Standard input (channel 0) reads input from the keyboard. 
            Standard output (channel 1) sends normal output to the terminal. Standard error (channel 2) sends error messages to the terminal.
            If a program opens separate connections to other files, then it might use higher-numbered file descriptors.
        </p>
        <img src="./images/0004.png" alt="img" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li><code>> file</code> Redirect stdout to overwrite a file</li>
            <li><code>>> file</code> Redirect stdout to append to a file</li>
            <li><code>2> file</code> Redirect stderr to overwrite a file</li>
            <li><code>2> /dev/null</code> Discard stderr error messages by redirecting them to /dev/null</li>
            <li><code>> file 2>&1</code> Redirect stdout and stderr to overwrite the same file</li>
            <li><code>>> file 2>&1</code> Redirect stdout and stderr to append to the same file</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands that are separated by the vertical bar character (|). 
            A pipeline connects the standard output of the first command to the standard input of the next command.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we combine redirection with a pipeline, the shell sets up the entire pipeline first, and then it redirects the input/output. 
            If you use output redirection in the middle of a pipeline, then the output goes to the file and not to the next command in the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next example, the output of the ls command goes to the /tmp/saved-output file, and the less command displays nothing on the terminal.
        </p>
        <code>ls > /tmp/saved-output | less</code>
        <p>
            The tee command overcomes this limitation. In a pipeline, tee copies its standard input to its standard output and also redirects its standard output to the files that are given as arguments to the command. 
            If we imagine data as water that flows through a pipeline, then we can visualize tee as a "T" joint in the pipe that directs output in two directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next example redirects the output of the ls command to the /tmp/saved-output file and passes it to the less command, so it is displayed on the terminal one screen at a time.
        </p>
        <code>ls -l | tee /tmp/saved-output | less</code>
        <p>
            If we use the tee command at the end of a pipeline, then the terminal shows the output of the commands in the pipeline and saves it to a file at the same time.
        </p>
        <code>ls -t | head -n 10 | tee /tmp/ten-last-changed-files</code>
        <p>
            Use the tee command -a option to append the content to a file instead of overwriting it.
        </p>
        <code>ls -l | tee -a /tmp/append-files</code>
        <p>
            The fundamental design principle of Linux is that it supports storage of the information and configuration settings in text-based files. 
            These files follow various structures such as lists of settings, INI-like formats, structured XML or YAML, and others. 
            The advantage of storing files in a text-based structure is that they are edited with any text editor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vim is an improved version of the vi editor, which is distributed with Linux and UNIX systems. Vim is a highly configurable and efficient editor that provides split-screen editing, color formatting, and highlighting for editing text.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vim editor offers various modes of operation such as command mode, extended command mode, edit mode, and visual mode. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An i keystroke enters insert mode, where all typed text becomes file content. Pressing Esc returns to command mode.</li>
            <li>A v keystroke enters visual mode, where multiple characters might be selected for text manipulation. Use Shift+V for multiline and Ctrl+V for block selection. To exit the visual mode, use the v, Shift+V, or Ctrl+V keystrokes.</li>
            <li>The : keystroke begins extended command mode for tasks such as writing the file (to save it) and quitting the Vim editor.</li>
            <li>The u key undoes the most recent edit.</li>
            <li>The x key deletes a single character.</li>
            <li>The :w command writes (saves) the file and remains in command mode for more editing.</li>
            <li>The :wq command writes (saves) the file and quits Vim.</li>
            <li>The :q! command quits Vim, and discards all file changes since the last write.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In Vim, we can yank and put (copy and paste), by using the y and p command characters. Position the cursor on the first character to select, 
            and then enter visual mode. Use the arrow keys to expand the visual selection. When ready, press y to yank the selection into memory. 
            Position the cursor at the new location, and then press p to put the selection at the cursor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visual mode is useful to highlight and manipulate text in different lines and columns. 
            We can enter various visual modes in Vim by using the following key combinations.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Character mode : v</li>
            <li>Line mode : Shift+v</li>
            <li>Block mode : Ctrl+v</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The /etc/vimrc and ~/.vimrc configuration files alter the behavior of the vim editor for the entire system or for a specific user respectively. 
            Within these configuration files, we can specify behavior such as the default tab spacing, syntax highlighting, color schemes, and more. 
            Modifying the behavior of the vim editor is particularly useful when working with languages such as YAML, which have strict syntax requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the Bash shell, we can set shell variables to help to run commands or to modify the behavior of the shell. 
            We can also export shell variables as environment variables, which are automatically copied to programs that are run from that shell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shell variables are unique to a particular shell session. If we have two terminal windows open, or two independent login sessions to the same remote server, 
            then we are running two shells. Each shell has its own set of values for its shell variables.
        </p>
        <code>VARIABLENAME=value</code><br>
        <code>echo $VARIABLENAME</code>
        <p>
            Some shell variables are set when Bash starts. We can modify them to adjust the shell's behavior.
            For example, the HISTFILE, HISTFILESIZE, and HISTTIMEFORMAT shell variables affect the shell history and the history command. 
            The HISTFILE variable specifies which file to save the shell history to, and defaults to the ~/.bash_history file. 
            The HISTFILESIZE variable specifies how many commands to save in that file from the history. 
            The HISTTIMEFORMAT variable defines the time stamp format for every command in the history.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shell provides an environment for the programs that we run from that shell. 
            Among other items, this environment includes information about the current working directory on the file system, 
            the command-line options that are passed to the program, and the values of environment variables. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If a shell variable is not an environment variable, then only the shell can use it. 
            However, if a shell variable is an environment variable, then the shell and any programs that run from that shell can use the variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can assign any variable that is defined in the shell as an environment variable by marking it for export with the export command.
        </p>
        <code>export EDITOR=vim</code>
        <p>An important environment variable is PATH. The PATH variable contains a list of colon-separated directories that contain programs.</p>
        <code>echo $PATH</code>
        <p>
            When We run a command such as the ls command, the shell looks for the ls executable file in each of those directories in order, 
            and runs the first matching file that it finds. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We can append directories to our PATH variable.
        </p>
        <code>export PATH=${PATH}:/home/user/sbin</code>
        <p>
            To list all the environment variables for a shell, run the env command
        </p>
        <p>
            When Bash starts, several text files run with shell commands that initialize the shell environment. 
            The exact scripts that run depend on whether the shell is interactive or non-interactive, and a login or non-login shell. 
            A user directly enters commands into an interactive shell, whereas a non-interactive shell, such as a script, runs in the background without user intervention. 
            A login shell is invoked when a user logs in locally via the terminal or remotely via the SSH protocol. 
            A non-login shell is invoked from an existing session, such as to open a terminal from the GNOME GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            For interactive login shells, the /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile files configure the Bash environment. 
            The /etc/profile and ~/.bash_profile files also source the /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc files respectively. 
            For interactive non-login shells, only the /etc/bashrc and ~/.bashrc files configure the Bash environment. 
            Whereas the /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc files apply to the whole system, the ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc files are user-specific. 
            Non-interactive shells invoke any files that the BASH_ENV variable defines.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a variable that is available to all of our interactive shells, edit the ~/.bashrc file. 
            To apply a variable only once after the user logs in, define it in the ~/.bash_profile file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bash aliases are shortcuts to other Bash commands. For example, if we must often type a long command, then we can create a shorter alias to invoke it. 
            We use the alias command to create aliases. Add aliases to a user's ~/.bashrc file so they are available in any interactive shell.
        </p>
        <code>alias hello='echo "Hello, this is a long string."'</code>
        <p>
            To unset and unexport a variable, use the <code>unset</code> command
        </p>
        <p>
            To unexport a variable without unsetting it, use the <code>export -n</code> command
        </p>
        <p>
            To unset an alias, use the <code>unalias</code> command
        </p>
