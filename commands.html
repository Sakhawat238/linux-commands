            The GNU Bourne-Again Shell (bash) is a program that interprets commands that the user types. 
            Each string that is typed into the shell can have up to three parts: the command, options 
            (which usually begin with a hyphen - or double hyphen -- characters), and arguments. 
            Each word that is typed into the shell is separated from other words with spaces.
